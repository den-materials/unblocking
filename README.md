# Unblocking

So you're stuck - STUCK stuck. It's more than a technical issue; you don't know where to start, or go next, or even what to start typing.

This kind of block is the most common in development. Code is finite and fixiable, but when you're tired, low on motivation, or mentally fried, it can be difficult to troubleshoot technical problems that seem unapproachable.

Below are a few tips for unblocking yourself, adapted from [Pixar's 22 Rules of Storytelling](http://io9.gizmodo.com/5916970/the-22-rules-of-storytelling-according-to-pixar). These work just as well for development issues as they do for writer's block, because they're essentially the same thing - **a failure of imagination**.


### 1: Finish your project, let go even if it’s not perfect. In an ideal world you have both, but move on. Do better next time.

### 2: When you’re stuck, make a list of what WOULDN’T fix your code. Lots of times the material to get you unstuck will show up.

### 3: Pull apart the apps you've built that work. What works in them is useful; and you’ve got to recognize it before you can use it.

### 4: Putting it into code lets you start fixing it. If it stays in your head, it will never have the chance to work.

### 5: No work is ever wasted. If it’s not working, let go and move on - it’ll come back around to be useful later.

Here are some more tips, though they haven't been vetted by Pixar:

### 1: Check EVERY TOOL:
- Dev Tools
- Terminal
- Google
- Robomongo
- Postman
- Browser (URL)

### 2: Identify the origin of the error
Is it in the backend? Frontend? Does removing a block of code fix it? Narrow it down until you know what line breaks your app.

### 3: Walk away!
Take a nap. Play a game. Cry and scream in your car. Get the emotions out so that you focus.

### 4: Accept Reality.
Your code is broken. Only you can fix it. You will have to spend lots of time reading vaguely related articles until you solve it. It will take an indeterminate amount of time, probably more than you want it to. These are facts that cannot be altered.

### 5: You are not the code.
You will not feel the pain of the code. 

### 6: This is hard, for you and everyone else.
No pain no gain. Every experienced dev started where you did. You will one day be where they are - unless you give up.

### 7: Find a (healthy) outlet for your frustation
